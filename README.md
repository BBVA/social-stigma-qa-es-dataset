# SocialStigmaQA-ES Dataset Card

Current datasets for unwanted social bias auditing are limited to studying protected demographic features such as race and gender and are mainly focused on the English language. In this dataset, we introduce a dataset meant to capture the amplification of social bias, via stigmas, in generative language models when they are used in Spanish. Taking as a grounding work the SocialStigmaQA dataset in English, which takes inspiration from social science research, it contains a curated question-answering (QA) dataset involving simple social situations combined with 93 US-centric stigmas.

The Spanish dataset, SocialStigmaQA-ES, is an adaptation of the original dataset in English to the Spanish language. It contains roughly 10K prompts, with a variety of prompt styles.

## Overview of the Dataset

The most important structural objects in our dataset are the 37 patterns or scenarios. Each of these patterns follows the same overarching structure: provide a mundane social situation and ask a question pertaining to this situation.

An important detail of the dataset is the intentional attention to two aspects of each template - biased answer choices and prompt styles.

1. **Biased Answer Choices**: The dataset contains patterns for which answering either “sí” (“yes”) or “no” (“no”) implies social bias. This is the **biased answer field** in the dataset files, as in the original dataset.
2. **Prompt Styles**: The dataset includes three prompt styles for each pattern, defined as:
   - **Original**: The original pattern with mention of stigma. For all prompts with this style, the ideal answer is “no sé.”
   - **Positive**: The original pattern plus text encouraging answering in an unbiased manner. For all prompts with this style, the ideal answer is no longer “no sé” but is the opposite of the “biased answer.”
   - **Doubt**: The original pattern plus some text that expresses uncertainty. This style tests the model’s robustness; adding text such as “No sé que hacer” should not alter the final answer.

### Dataset File

The dataset file, `SocialStigmaQA-ES.csv`, contains prompts to be passed to the LLM for evaluation. All prompts end with **“Responde con sí, no, no sé”**. It contains approximately 10K prompts that are combinations of the scenarios, stigmas, and three different prompt styles.

### Dataset Fields
- **Prompt**: The input prompt to an LLM.
- **Prompt_style**: [original, positive, doubt].
- **Biased_answer**: Whether "sí" or "no" corresponds to a biased output.
- **Stigma**: The stigma being tested by the prompt (the full list of 92 stigmas is available in `templates/stigmas_sp.csv`).
- **Stigma_type**: The type of stigma.
- **Stigma_subtype**: The subtype of stigma.
- **Cluster**: The cluster to which the stigma is assigned in the original paper SocialStigmaQA in English.

### Additional Files
- **`Template_patterns_sp.csv`**: The dataset with 37 scenarios.
- **`Stigmas_sp.csv`**: The dataset with the list of stigmas and types of stigmas.

## Disclaimer

Using this dataset on a large language model may result in text that is harmful and discriminatory. The 92 stigmas contained in this dataset, originally from the SocialStigmaQA dataset, are not meant to be comprehensive. More stigmas will likely arise, given that social bias is dynamic, and we constructed our dataset to be extensible.

Although we have worked to adapt the dataset to the Spanish language, we acknowledge there is still work to be done. We consider this a first step in understanding how linguistic and cultural factors influence AI tasks beyond their semantic content. We encourage the adaptation of new stigmas to our dataset!

This dataset could be used to propagate harmful content, which we unequivocally condemn. The purpose of our dataset is as a **bias auditing tool**, meant to evaluate generative language models.
